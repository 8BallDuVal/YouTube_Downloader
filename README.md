# YouTube_Downloader
Download YouTube Videos to MP3 or MP4 using this program! 

NOTE: In addition to the steps below, you also need to download the "exe_files.zip" file and put the 3 .exe files (ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, and ffprobe.exe) in a folder where Windows can find it (after unzipping it of course). This simply means put the following files in folders such as: "C:\Windows\system32" or "C:\Windows" or make a new folder, copy these 3 files there and add the path of that folder in window "path" environment variable (Control Panel >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Environment Variables >> Path).

Simply download the "YouTube Downloader.exe" file and follow the instructions! The source code for this executable is "downloaderGUI.py". 

Instructions on how to use "yt_downloader_CLI.exe" (source code for this executable is "downloader.py"):
1. Copy an entire Youtube URL and paste it into the program, then hit Enter.
2. Enter Downloads, Documents, Desktop, or 1, 2, or 3 to designate where the file will be downloaded. The Desktop is the default download destination, so if none of these options are chosen for whatever reason, the program defaults to choosing the Desktop.
3. Enter MP3 or MP4 or determine which filetype you would like to download. MP3 is an audio format and MP4 is a video/audio format.

Roadmap: Update the "YouTube Downloader.exe" file to include the three executables needed in the zip file automatically.
