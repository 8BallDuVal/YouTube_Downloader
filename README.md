# YouTube_Downloader
Download YouTube Videos to MP3 or MP4 using this program! 

Simply download the "YouTube Downloader.exe" file and follow the instructions! The source code for this executable is "downloaderGUI.py". ***To use this program for MP3 files, see the note below.

Instructions on how to use "yt_downloader_CLI.exe" (source code for this executable is "downloader.py"):
1. Copy an entire Youtube URL and paste it into the program, then hit Enter.
2. Enter Downloads, Documents, Desktop, or 1, 2, or 3 to designate where the file will be downloaded. The Desktop is the default download destination, so if none of these options are chosen for whatever reason, the program defaults to choosing the Desktop.
3. Enter MP3 or MP4 or determine which filetype you would like to download. MP3 is an audio format and MP4 is a video/audio format. 

***NOTE: If you would like to download YouTube videos as MP3 files, in addition to the steps below, you also need to download the "exe_files.zip" file, unzip it, and put the 3 .exe files (ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, and ffprobe.exe) in a folder where Windows can find it. This simply means put the 3 .exe files in folders such as: "C:\Windows\system32" or "C:\Windows" or make a new folder, copy these 3 files there and add the filepath of that folder into the Windows "path" environment variable (Control Panel >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Environment Variables >> Path).

Roadmap: Update the "YouTube Downloader.exe" file to include the three executables needed in the zip file automatically.
