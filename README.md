# YouTube_Downloader
Download YouTube Videos to MP3 or MP4 using this simple CLI.

Simply download the downloader.exe file and follow the instructions! 
1. Copy an entire Youtube URL and paste it into the program, then hit Enter.
2. Enter Downloads, Documents, Desktop, or 1, 2, or 3 to designate where the file will be downloaded. The Desktop is the default download destination, so if none of these options are chosen for whatever reason, the program defaults to choosing the Desktop.
3. Enter MP3 or MP4 or determine which filetype you would like to download. MP3 is an audio format and MP4 is a video/audio format. 


Note: If you have python 3 installed, you can just run the downloader.py file. 
- Make sure that you have used pip to install the youtube-dl package, and that you also have downloaded the ffmpeg zip file. 
- Unzip the contents of the ffmpeg zip file and copy the contents (three .exe files) of the "bin" folder to your main python installation folder on your C:\ drive (ex: C:\Python37), making sure that the Python directory has been added to your computer's environment/PATH variables.
- If you have any questions about how this works, feel free to reach out! My email is dduval6@outlook.com
